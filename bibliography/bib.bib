	abstract  = {Event sequence data is increasingly available in various application domains, such as business process management, software engineering, or medical pathways. Processes in these domains are typically represented as process diagrams or flow charts. So far, various techniques have been developed for automatically generating such diagrams from event sequence data. An open challenge is the visual analysis of drift phenomena when processes change over time. In this paper, we address this research gap. Our contribution is a system for fine-granular process drift detection and corresponding visualizations for event logs of executed business processes. We evaluated our system both on synthetic and real-world data. On synthetic logs, we achieved an average F-score of 0.96 and outperformed all the state-of-the-art methods. On real-world logs, we identified all types of process drifts in a comprehensive manner. Finally, we conducted a user study highlighting that our visualizations are easy to use and useful as perceived by process mining experts. In this way, our work contributes to research on process mining, event sequence analysis, and visualization of temporal data.},

  abstract  = {Declarative process specifications define the behavior of processes by means of rules based on Linear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces LTLf. In a mining context, these specifications are inferred from, and checked on, multi-sets of runs recorded by information systems (namely, event logs). To this end, being able to gauge the degree to which process data comply with a specification is key. However, existing mining and verification techniques analyze the rules in isolation, thereby disregarding their interplay. In this paper, we introduce a framework to devise probabilistic measures for declarative process specifications. Thereupon, we propose a technique that measures the degree of satisfaction of specifications over event logs. To assess our approach, we conduct an evaluation with real-world data, evidencing its applicability for diverse process mining tasks, including discovery, checking, and drift detection.},

	abstract  = {The online monitoring of collaborative business processes involves the integration of event data sourced from various information systems into a unified process state. The transmission of process records across organizational boundaries poses significant data secrecy and security challenges. In this context, organizations may be reluctant to outsource sensitive data with their collaborators to update a global process state. In this paper, we propose ProMTEE, a novel framework designed to tackle these challenges by resorting to trusted applications running in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). To showcase the potential of ProMTEE, we contextualize its four-staged interaction protocol within the realm of two online monitoring tasks, namely, control flow tracking and compliance monitoring. We verify the security of our solution through a threat analysis against a set of security requirements derived from a supply-chain scenario. In addition, we conduct an experimental assessment of our proof-of-concept implementation with tests on memory usage and latency using real-world datasets.},
