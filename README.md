# letter-2-reviewers-LaTeX-template
A LaTeX template to write response letters for journal revisions. Please find detailed usage instructions directly in the `letter.pdf` file.

This template has been used in the course of the revision rounds of a number of publications, including the ones below. It goes without saying, the list is biased by the author’s personal experience. If you want to share your experience with this template, feel free to do so (e.g., via LinkedIn [linkedin.com/in/claudiodiciccio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudiodiciccio/)).
